This solution concerns only the update of the board, which is done in-place.

And here is Game of Life, full version with animation in Java!

Done at the beginning of 2017, the yearly years of my programming experience.
It is not perfect, and if I were to implement it today, I would have done many things differently.

And yet, it is a fully functioning animated version, done just a year after I started seriously
learning programming. I have come a long way since then, with more than 100 000 (one hundred thousand)
lines of code under my belt, as of today, April 2022. And these are very conservative estimates.
